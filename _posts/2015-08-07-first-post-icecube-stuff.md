title: First post - IceCube Stuff

So my webpage isn't so empty, I thought I'd devote a post to talking about one of my favorite ongoing experiments, the [IceCube Neutrino Observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu/).  IceCube is a particle detector that detects scattered [Cherenkov Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation) from charged particles that result from (exceedingly) rare neutrino interactions speeding through the Antarctic ice.

As an undergraduate I had some hands-on experience with the reconstruction process-- the process of interpreting the sensed light and reconstructing information about the neutrino event that caused it (Where did the neutrino come from? How fast was it going? What [flavor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavour_%28particle_physics%29) was it?).

The whole process always reminded me of the [scene in The Dark Knight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30Ddn5e598Y) where Batman reconstructs a bullet from the shards to find the thumb print made when the bullet was first loaded.

My specific research involved the data-driven characterization of the IceCube optical sensors.  Because the reconstruction methods were generative models, this basically had the effect of improving the prior distribution.  Why bother, you ask? Because [PINGU](http://icecube.wisc.edu/news/view/186) needed a better model if it wanted to accurately reconstruct low energy neutrino interactions.

Also in my time, I was made aware of a band of (possibly) the most insane people left on the planet, IceCube "Winter Overs".

Winter Overs are modern-day Vikings who agree to spend more than a year at the actual station in Antarctica, sustaining themselves only on home-made snow cones and their love of science (I assume).  If there are positions open, consider [applying!](https://icecube.wisc.edu/jobs/show/winter_over_pos)
