title: Decisive Plays in Superbowl 50
---

Short post today-- just wanted to share these charts that I made following this weekend's Superbowl game between the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers.  What I've done is grab estimated play-by-play win probabilities from [here](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201602070den.htm) and rank plays according to how much win probability they added.  Denver's defense came out as the star of the show, with Manning's offense only generating 5 of the top 25 most decisive plays.  Plays in the top 25 include forced turnovers, critical third-down stops, and long returns on special teams.

Peyton Manning truly has his defense to thank for this Superbowl victory agains the heavily-favored Carolina Panthers who had a more even mix of offense and defense in their most decisive plays.  Their largest spike in win probability came on a third down stop of Broncos running back C.J. Anderson late in the fourth quarter.

In conclusion, defensive coordinators from high schools and colleges around the country can now let out a hearty "I told you so".
