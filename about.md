I have a B.S. in Physics with a special interest in high-energy particle physics. I worked on R&D and verification for [PINGU](http://icecube.wisc.edu/news/view/186), the proposed update to the [IceCube Neutrino Observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu/).  I'm currently employed as a data scientist, and I'm a sucker for [good data visualizations](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery).

I enjoy finding and analyzing web data, particle physics data, and social/behavioral data. This site will be home to visualizations and commentary on any and all of these.
